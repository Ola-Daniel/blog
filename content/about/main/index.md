  I’ve always been fascinated by technology and its power to solve complex problems, which naturally led me to pursue a career in cloud and security.

  As a Cloud Security Engineer, I focus on designing, implementing, and securing cloud infrastructure to support modern applications. I’m especially drawn to the automation side of DevOps, where I see opportunities for teams to work more efficiently and effectively. With hands-on experience across AWS, Azure, and GCP, I’m always eager to explore emerging cloud technologies and practices.

  Security is a core part of my work and passion. In today’s landscape of evolving cyber threats, I believe every technology professional should understand cybersecurity fundamentals. I continuously expand my knowledge of the latest threats, defenses, and best practices to help strengthen organisational resilience.

  Outside of work, I enjoy reading about advancements in space technology, programming, and tackling security challenges on platforms like HackTheBox and TryHackMe.

  Thanks for stopping by! If you’d like to connect or discuss cloud security, feel free to reach out. I’d be happy to chat.
